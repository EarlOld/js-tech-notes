# Typed Arrays in JavaScript
Typed Arrays in JavaScript provide a way to work with binary data in a more efficient manner than traditional arrays. They are particularly useful for handling large amounts of data, such as in graphics programming, audio processing, and other performance-critical applications.

## Overview
Typed Arrays consist of two main components:
1. **ArrayBuffer**: A generic, fixed-length binary data buffer.
2. **Typed Array Views**: These are views that provide a way to read and write to the ArrayBuffer in a specific format (e.g., Int8Array, Float32Array, etc.).

## Common Typed Array Types
- `Int8Array`: 8-bit signed integer
- `Uint8Array`: 8-bit unsigned integer
- `Uint8ClampedArray`: 8-bit unsigned integer clamped to [0, 255]
- `Int16Array`: 16-bit signed integer
- `Uint16Array`: 16-bit unsigned integer
- `Int32Array`: 32-bit signed integer
- `Uint32Array`: 32-bit unsigned integer
- `Float32Array`: 32-bit floating point
- `Float64Array`: 64-bit floating point
